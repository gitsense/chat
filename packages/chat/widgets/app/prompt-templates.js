let COMPARE=`
Below you will find an:

* optional system prompt (<system_prompt>)
* user message (<user_message>)
* {{num-responses}} responses (<llm_response_x>) generated by different LLMs on the same topic.  

Please analyze the responses and provide an assessment of their similarity.

{{system}}

{{user}}

### Responses:

{{responses}}

### Pre-analysis Instructions

* When referencing response 1, response 2, etc. in your analysis, please use the LLM name instead. For example, if response 1 was <llm_response_1 (GPT-4o)>, please say "Response by GPT-4o" instead of "Response 1".
* When responding, do not include introductory phrases like "I'll analyze..." or similar personal language.

### Analysis Instructions and Output Format

1. Create a table with all LLM responders and a quick one or two sentence summary.  Do not include a section header for the table. For the response column, just use the LLM name. Create only the table and do include any non-table headings like "Summary" and so forth.
2. Create a paragraph summarizing the similarity between the responses in terms of content and key points. Do not create a section header for the paragraph.
3. Create a commonalities section (### Commonalities) and identify any common points that appear in all or most of the responses.
4. Create a differences section (### Differences) and highlight any significant differences in information provided. Ignore tone and styling differences in the responses.
5. Create a similarity rating section with the score in the header (### Similarity Ratings <score>) and provide a rating (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 10) to indicate how similar the responses are overall, with 1 being very dissimilar and 10 being nearly identical. Ignore styling differences and just focus on key points.

Please provide your analysis in a clear and structured format.
`,EVALUATE_MODEL=`
The XML-style tags below represent a {{llm}} conversation, where user messages are enclosed in <user_message> tags and assistant responses in <assistant_message> tags. In addition to the user and assistant messages, you may also find a system prompt message enclosed in <system_message>.

{{messages}}

When responding for the first time:

1. Print the sentence "Evaluation of {{llm}} responses" followed by a newline. Note, replace <llm> with the name of the LLM.
2. If you understand, ask how you can help by summarizing the topic that the assistants responded to then provide 3 suggestions on how you can help as an ordered list.
`,EVALUATE=`
Below you will find an:

* optional system prompt (<system_prompt>)
* user message (<user_message>
* {{num-responses}} responses (<llm_response_x>) generated by different language models on the same topic.

### Note

* When referencing response 1, response 2, etc. in your analysis, please use the LLM name instead. For example, if response 1 was <llm_response_1 (GPT-4o)>, please say "Response by GPT-4o" instead of "Response 1".
* When responding, do not include introductory phrases like "I'll analyze..." or similar personal language.

### First Response Instructions

1. Print the sentence "Evaluation of LLM responses" followed by a newline. Note, replace <llm> with the name of the LLM.
2. If you understand, ask how you can help by summarizing the topic that the assistants responded to then provide 3 suggestions on how you can help as an ordered list.
`,VALIDATE=`
Below you will find an:

* LLM (<llm>)
* optional system prompt (<system_prompt>)
* user message (<user_message>)
* assistant response (<assistant_response>)  

Please analyze the assistant's message for accuracy.

### First Response Instructions

1. Print the sentence "Analysis of <llm> response" followed by a newline. Note, replace <llm> with the name of the LLM.
2. First verify if the solution directly answers the specific question asked:
    - Does the primary solution address the core question?
    - Are there any mismatches between the question and the solution?
    - Is the solution solving a different problem than what was asked?
3. For any code examples:
    - Mentally execute the code and verify it produces the claimed result
    - Verify the code solves the original problem, not a related but different problem
    - Check if any examples might mislead users about the solution's applicability
4. Before assigning accuracy:
    - Assume the response might be wrong
    - Look for logical flaws, not just technical correctness
    - Question if the solution actually solves the user's problem
3. Create an accuracy section (#### Accuracy) and specify a percentage from 0% to 100%.
    * Only print the percentage and nothing else.
    * Treat severe inaccuracies very harshly.
4. If the percentage is less than 85% explain why in great detail.

**IMPORTANT** 

* When responding, do not include introductory phrases like "I'll analyze..." or similar personal language.
* Do not provide an assesment of accuracy until you have thoroughly evaluate the response. 
* Use h4 for headers in your response.
* After the first response, reply normally
`,SUGGEST_CHAT_TITLE=`
Below you will find an:

* optional system prompt (<system_prompt>)
* user message (<user_message>)
* assistant message (<assistant_response>)  

{{system}}
{{user}}
{{assistant}}

Suggest a concise and relevant title for the chat messages above. Limit the title to a maximum of 10 words. Only return the title, with no additional text.
`,SUMMARIZE=`
Please provide a concise summary of the following conversation. Focus on:
1. Main topic(s) discussed
2. Key decisions or conclusions reached
3. Any important action items or next steps

If a system prompt is present, include its core intent only if relevant to the conversation flow.

Keep the summary under 3-4 sentences unless the conversation complexity absolutely requires more.

Conversation to summarize:
