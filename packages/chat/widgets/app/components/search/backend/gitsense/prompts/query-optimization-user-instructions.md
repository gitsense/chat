Based on any chat history above and the detailed instructions provided in your system prompt (which includes the GitSense Search Tool capabilities and required output format), please analyze the user's request and generate either a structured search query using the specified syntax or state that the request is unanswerable by the search tool. Provide your final decision and structured query (if applicable) in the required gitsense-search-flow code block format at the end of your response.

Before answering, make sure to carefully read the system prompt instructions and to follow the rules set out in the section `### Decision Priority`.  If there is enough information in the system prompt to answer, make sure to answer using natural language for the query/request defined in the system prompt section `### User Query or Request`.
