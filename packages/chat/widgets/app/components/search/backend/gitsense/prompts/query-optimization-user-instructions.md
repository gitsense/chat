"Please remember: If you are providing a direct answer (e.g., listing available analyzers, listing analyzer schemas, etc.), ensure the natural language explanation is provided first, immediately followed by the gitsense-search-flow block with type: 'answered'."

Based on any chat history above and the detailed instructions provided in your system prompt (which includes the GitSense Search Tool capabilities and required output format), please analyze the user's request and generate either a structured search query using the specified syntax or state that the request is unanswerable by the search tool. Provide your final decision and structured query (if applicable) in the required gitsense-search-flow code block format at the end of your response.
