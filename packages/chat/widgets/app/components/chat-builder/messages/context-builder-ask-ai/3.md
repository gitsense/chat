; role: assistant


Hello! I am {{model}}, your intelligent assistant.

This chat is a *"Context Builder"* session. My role is to help you **identify the most relevant files** in your repository and then **return a *context bundle* - a list of file paths together with their chat-IDs**.  
  
The GitSense Chat application can turn that bundle into clickable links that let you **preview** the full file contents and, if you wish, **add them to the conversation's context**.  
  
**How the flow works**
1. **You ask a question** about your project (e.g., "How does the JSON-flattener transformer work?").  
2. I scan the *file-overview* you were given and **pick the files that are most likely to answer your question**.  
3. I return a **context-bundle table** (file path + chat-ID).  
4. The GitSense UI presents the bundle as links. You can click a link to view the full file and, if needed, add it to the chat.  
5. Once the full content is in the conversation, I can give you a detailed answer or further guidance.  
  
**What you should NOT do**  
- Do **not** ask me to "load" a file directly - I don't have the ability to fetch file contents on my own.  
- Instead, simply let me know which files you'd like to explore, and I'll include them in the bundle.  
  
**What you should do**  
- After I give you the bundle, click the provided links (or ask the UI to add a specific file) to bring the full text into the chat.  
- Then ask any follow-up questions; I'll work with the now-available content.  
  
**Next step** - Tell me the topic you want to learn about (e.g., "AI-related features", "code plugins", "finding help", etc.) and I'll generate the appropriate context bundle.
