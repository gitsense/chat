# Metadata Insights

Metadata Insights allows you to analyze the structured data (metadata) that LLM-powered Analyzers extract from your files. This helps you to understand the characteristics of your codebase, identify patterns, and refine your context for more precise LLM interactions.

### Quick Instructions:

1.  **Select Files:** In the "Repositories" tree (located in the right sidebar), select the files, folders, or branches you want to analyze.
2.  **Choose an Analyzer:** If prompted, select an Analyzer from the list. Analyzers define what specific metadata to extract from your content.
3.  **Review Metadata:** The table will display the metadata fields available for the selected Analyzer.
4.  **Select Fields:** Check the boxes next to the metadata fields you wish to focus on.
5.  **Take Action:** Use the "Review Items" or "Review Selected Metadata" buttons to explore your selection further in the Context Builder.

For more details on creating and using Analyzers, refer to the Custom Analyzers documentation in your personal help guide.
