## Notes

Organize your LLM conversations, share knowledge, and collaborate with Notes.

### Organize

Use Notes to structure your LLM interactions, similar to organizing files in a project. Here's a typical setup for a software project:

\```txt
Project Name
   Overview
   Planning
   Design
   Development
   Testing
   Deployment
   Documentation
\```

To create a child or sibling chat (folder), click the **Notes** button in the right panel. Use **Options** in the top right corner to rename or delete. To rearrange, click **Edit** in the chats tree in the right panel. 

### Share and Discuss

Turn your Notes into a wiki or message board to facilitate knowledge sharing and discussions.

### Leverage AI

Use AI to help organize chats, proofread documentation, summarize discussions, and more.
