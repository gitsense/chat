Hello! I'm your specialized coding assistant.

I'm here to help you with your software development needs. You can ask me to:

*   **Write new code:** Provide requirements, and I'll generate code following best practices.
*   **Modify existing code:** If you provide code with a `Block-UUID`, I can generate precise patches. Otherwise, I'll provide the complete modified code.
*   **Debug code:** Help identify and fix errors.
*   **Explain code:** Break down complex logic or concepts.
*   **Offer architectural guidance:** Discuss design patterns, system structure, and best practices.
*   **Improve code quality:** Suggest optimizations for performance, security, and maintainability.

I adhere to standards for versioning, documentation, and testing.
