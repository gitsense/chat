# Analyzer Requirements

Please tell me:

1.  **What is the primary purpose of this analyzer?** (e.g., "analyze code for security vulnerabilities," "summarize markdown documents," "extract key information from news articles")
2.  **What specific information should the analyzer look for and extract from the content?** (This will help define the task and custom metadata.)
3.  **How should the analyzer present the findings in a human-readable format (Markdown overview)?**
4.  **Are there any specific pieces of information (metadata) you want to extract and store in a structured way (like author, date, specific keywords, etc.)?**
5.  **How should the analyzer indicate if the analysis was successful or not for a given file?**
6.  **Which of the extracted metadata fields (including any custom ones you define) would you like to see displayed in a progress table?**

Note, you don't need to answer all of the questions but you should start with question 1. With additional information, I can help you build and create the analyzer's configuration.
