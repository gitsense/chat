# Data Insights

Welcome! This chat will guide you on how to leverage GitSense Chat for powerful data analysis. Our unique approach allows you to:

*   **Import your data:** Use the GitSense Chat Bridge CLI to import your Git repositories and soon other data sources like GitHub issues and pull requests.
*   **Load your data:** Select and refine your imported data using the "Repositories" tree and Context Builder, preparing it for your chat.
*   **Enrich your data:** Optionally, create custom analyzers to extract new, structured information from your content, enabling powerful filtering, custom reports, and more effective AI interactions.
*   **Chat about your data:** Use an LLM to explore and understand your data, addressing questions and uncovering insights.

### Import Data

Import your Git repositories to transform their content and history into interactive chats within the app.

**GitSense Chat Bridge CLI:**

`gscb` is a command-line tool that facilitates importing various data sources, starting with Git repositories, into your GitSense Chat database.

**Example:**

To import the `main` branch of your local Git repository into your database:

\`\`\`bash
gscb import git --repo ./my-repo --owner my-org --name my-project --ref main --ref-type branch --db ./gitsense.db
\`\`\`

After import, your repository's files and directories will appear as navigable chats, ready for analysis.

### Load Data

After importing your data, you can load specific content for analysis into your chat. This process involves selecting items from the "Repositories" tree and refining them in the Context Builder.

1.  **Navigate and Select from the Tree:**
    *   Browse the "Repositories" tree in the sidebar, which organizes your imported Git data by repository owner, name, and reference (branch, commit, or tag).
    *   To quickly select all files and directories within a branch or folder, simply check the box next to its name (e.g., the `main` branch).
    *   **Recommendation for Large Repositories:** For very large repositories, it is strongly recommended to select only the specific sub-trees or individual files you need directly from the "Repositories" tree. This initial narrowing is more efficient than attempting to filter an extensive dataset later in the Context Builder.

2.  **Refine Selection in the Context Builder:**
    *   Once you have made your initial selection, click the "Review" button in the selection component (located above the tree). This will open the Context Builder.
    *   In the Context Builder, you can further refine your selection using various filters, including:
        *   **Enriched Metadata:** Filter based on metadata extracted by analyzers (e.g., file purpose, code component, author).
        *   **File Path:** Use patterns to include or exclude files based on their path.
        *   **Language:** Filter by programming language.
        *   **Keywords:** Filter by keywords associated with the content.

3.  **AI-Assisted Refinement with "Ask AI":**
    *   If you are unfamiliar with a large codebase or dataset, the "Ask AI" feature within the Context Builder is designed to help you refine your selection.
    *   You can tell the AI what you hope to accomplish (e.g., "I want to understand the authentication flow," or "Find files related to data processing").
    *   The AI will then suggest relevant files based on their purpose descriptions and keywords.

4.  **Add to Chat:**
    *   Once you have finalized your selection in the Context Builder, click the "Add" button. This will insert the prepared content into your current chat conversation, making it available for the LLM to review and respond to your queries.

### Enrich Data

Data enrichment allows you to add new, structured information to your imported content, making it more powerful for filtering, custom reports, and AI interactions.

1.  **Create a Custom Analyzer:** Click the **"New Analyzer"** button to initiate a new analyzer chat; follow the instructions within that chat to define your custom analyzer.
2.  **Run an Analysis:** Click the **"Analyze"** button to initate an new analyze chat; follow the instructions within that chat to start analyzing.

### Chat About Your Data

Using an LLM with your prepared and enriched data allows for advanced interactions with your content:

*   **Ask Targeted Questions:** Formulate highly specific questions by utilizing the enriched metadata (e.g., "Summarize the purpose of all Python files modified last month," or "Identify functions related to 'user authentication' across multiple repositories").
*   **Analyze Relationships:** Have the LLM analyze relationships and patterns across multiple selected files or data points.
*   **Problem Solve and Debug:** Provide code snippets, error logs, or design documents and ask the LLM to help identify issues, suggest solutions, or propose refactoring strategies.
*   **Understand Context:** Obtain explanations of complex code, technical documents, or historical changes, based on the specific context you provide.
*   **Generate Summaries and Reports:** Instruct the LLM to generate concise summaries, overviews, or draft reports based on the content and metadata you've loaded.
