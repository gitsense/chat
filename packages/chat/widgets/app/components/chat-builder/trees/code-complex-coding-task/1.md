## Coding Task

**Suggested Workflow for Completing Coding Tasks Using LLMs**

This workflow is designed to help you organize your thoughts and focus on gathering the right information to write prompts that can provide the LLM with sufficient context to be effective. By following these steps (not necessarily all of them), you should be able to work more effectively with LLMs to help you write code, review code, write documentation, and more.

### 1. Planning
Define the scope, timeline, and required resources for the task.

### 2. Create an Issue
Document feature requests or bug reports clearly.

### 3. Analyze Requirements
Understand the requirements and gather necessary information.

### 4. Design the Solution
Plan the implementation and architecture of the solution.

### 5. Implement the Code
Write clean, maintainable code based on the design.

### 6. Create a Pull Request
Document changes and request code reviews.

### 7. Testing and Review
Ensure the new feature or bug fix works as intended and meets quality standards.

### 8. Documentation
Create comprehensive technical and user documentation.

### Additional Considerations
- **Data Privacy**: Be cautious about sharing sensitive code or information with LLMs.
- **Verification**: Always verify LLM outputs against current best practices and project requirements.
- **Context Awareness**: Remember that LLMs lack project-specific context; supplement their suggestions with your expertise.
- **Security**: Double-check the security implications of any code or design suggestions provided by the LLM.
- **Team Standards**: Ensure that the use of LLMs aligns with your team's practices and policies.
