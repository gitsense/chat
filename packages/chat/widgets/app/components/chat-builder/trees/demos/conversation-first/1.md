> GitSense Chat Demos: Conversation First

## Conversation First Demo

Welcome! This demo highlights how GitSense Chat is designed from the ground up to make your conversations with LLMs more ergonomic, efficient, and valuable-especially when working with code or complex ideas.

We believe a great conversation interface is key to unlocking the full potential of AI assistance. Let's explore some features that make chatting in GitSense Chat uniquely comfortable and productive.

### 1. Optimizing View: Conversation Width

When reviewing LLM-generated code or long explanations, having enough screen space is crucial.

**Try it now:**

1.  Look for the **gear icon** in the **top-right corner** of this chat page.
2.  Click the gear icon. A dropdown menu will appear.
3.  Select a **"Conversation Width"** option (e.g., **1024px**). Custom widths will be supported in the future.

### 2. Resizing the Chat Input Box

Crafting detailed prompts or pasting code snippets is much easier with a larger input area.

**Try it now:**

1.  Locate the **chat input box** at the bottom of the screen.
2.  Find the **grabber icon** (six dots arranged in a 2x3 grid) just above the input box.
3.  Click and **drag the grabber upwards** to increase the height of the input box.

### 3. Disabling "Send on Enter"

For longer, multi-line messages, accidentally sending too early can be frustrating.

**Try it now:**

1.  Find the **"Send on enter"** toggle above the chat input box at the bottom of the screen..
2.  Click it to **disable** sending messages with just the Enter key. You will now need to click the 'Send' button or use `Ctrl+Enter`/`Cmd+Enter`.

### 4. Extracting Value: The Messages Tool

GitSense Chat is designed to empower you, not lock you in. The Messages Tool lets you easily extract conversation content for use elsewhere.

**Try it now:**

1.  Look for the **"MT" button** in the **Conversation Control Panel** (usually a floating bar on the left side of the screen), or click the "Messages Tool" button at the top of the conversation.
2.  Click the **"MT" or "Messages Tool" button**. The **Messages Tool** modal will open.
3.  In the modal, you can:
    *   See a list of all messages.
    *   Filter messages by **Role** (User, Assistant, System).
    *   Select specific messages using checkboxes.
    *   Choose a format (e.g., "Simple", "Tagged").
    *   Click **"Copy"** to transfer the selected content to your clipboard.
