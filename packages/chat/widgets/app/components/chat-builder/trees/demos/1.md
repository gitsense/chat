Welcome to GitSense Chat, your intelligent partner in software development! Get ready to explore a powerful LLM-powered platform designed to enhance your workflow with precise context engineering, traceable code generation, and advanced AI-assisted search and data analysis.

These guided demos are designed to walk you through our key features, showing you firsthand how GitSense Chat can redefine the way you work with AI to develop software better, together.

### Demos:

*   [**Code Generation & Traceability**](): Learn how GitSense Chat generates code and provides unparalleled traceability for every AI-assisted change.

*   [**AI-Assisted Search & Analyzers**](): Discover how to leverage AI-powered Analyzers to perform intelligent semantic searches and extract actionable insights from your data.

*   [**Context Engineering & Management**](): Master the art of building, refining, and managing precise LLM context to enhance accuracy, reduce costs, and streamline your workflows.

### Beyond the Demos

As you go through these demos, you'll also be implicitly experiencing other unique aspects of GitSense Chat:

*   **No Lock-in, Just Better Workflows:** After finishing the "Context Engineering & Management" demo, look for **the** "MT" button on the left docking bar. Click it to learn how easy it is to extract and port any part of the conversation for **use** in your IDE or other tools.

*   **Next-Gen Knowledge Base:** This very demo is a live example of our "Next-Gen Knowledge Base" in action. You're interacting with a "chatable" tutorial, demonstrating how GitSense Chat transforms static documentation into a dynamic, AI-powered learning experience.

*   **Interactive Messages:** Notice how the demo guides you with clickable links and pre-filled commands? This is a glimpse into our extensible architecture, where LLM outputs become dynamic, actionable elements, making your chat truly come alive.
