## Analyzers

Analyzers are intelligent tools that instruct an LLM to extract specific, structured data (metadata) from any content you provide - whether it's code, documents, notes, or more. This transforms unstructured information into filterable, actionable insights.

**For a hands-on, step-by-step guide on creating your first Analyzer, we highly recommend following the interactive tutorial: [Creating Your First Analyzer]({{chat-uuid-link}}).**

### I. What is an Analyzer?

An Analyzer is essentially a set of instructions you give to an LLM, telling it:
*   **What to look for:** Specific patterns, concepts, or information within a document.
*   **What to extract:** Key data points that you want to pull out.
*   **How to structure it:** Define the format (e.g., a JSON schema) for the extracted data.
*   **How to summarize:** Provide a human-readable overview of its findings.

**Why it's useful:**
*   **Structured Data from Unstructured Content:** Turn free-form text (like code comments, meeting notes, or articles) into organized, queryable data.
*   **Enables Powerful Search and Filtering:** Once data is structured, you can:
    - Use it in the Context Builder's Metadata Filter to precisely select files (e.g., "has_spelling_mistake=true") 
    - Use it to ask AI `/ask find me files with spelling mistakes in the hello world repo`.
*   **Automates Insights:** Get automated summaries and key takeaways from large volumes of content.
*   **Enhances Context Building:** Use extracted metadata to precisely filter and select relevant files for LLM context, saving tokens and improving response accuracy.

In short, Analyzers make your data smarter and your AI interactions far more powerful.

### II. How to Create a Custom Analyzer (Chat-Driven Process)

Creating an Analyzer is a conversational process. You'll chat with an LLM, describing your requirements, and it will help you build the Analyzer's configuration.

**The Process:**
1.  **Launch the "New Analyzer" Chat:** Click the **"Analyzers" button** in the right sidebar, then select **"New Analyzer"**.
2.  **Define Requirements:** In the new chat, you'll be prompted with a series of questions to describe what your Analyzer should do. Respond in natural language, detailing:
    *   The Analyzer's purpose.
    *   What information to extract.
    *   How to structure the extracted metadata (e.g., JSON schema).
    *   The desired human-readable summary format.
3.  **LLM Generates Configuration:** As you provide details, the LLM constructs the Analyzer's technical configuration, including instructions for the analysis LLM and the metadata schema.
4.  **Save Your Analyzer:** If the instructions were properly generated, a save button will appear which you can use to save or update an existing analyzer.

> Pro Tip: Re-use your "New Analyzer" chat to let the LLM know what worked and what didn't to further refine the instructions.

### III. Leveraging Your Custom Analyzer

After creation, your Analyzer becomes a powerful tool:

1.  **Context Builder's Metadata Filter:** Select your Analyzer in the Context Builder to filter files based on extracted metadata.
2.  **AI-Assisted Search:** Use your Analyzer in advanced `/search` or `/ask` queries to find files based on extracted metadata.
3.  **Actionable LLM Output (Decorators):** In the future, custom handlers can leverage your Analyzer's metadata to create interactive elements in chat messages (e.g., a "Flag for Review" button if `needs_review` metadata is `true`).

By creating custom Analyzers, you transform GitSense Chat into a highly specialized data analysis platform tailored to your exact needs, all without writing code.
