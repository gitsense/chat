> GitSense Chat Help: Administration / Managing LLM Models and Providers

## Managing LLM Models and Providers

GitSense Chat allows you to configure and manage the Large Language Models (LLMs) and their providers that you use for your AI interactions. This is done via the `gsc-admin` command-line tool.

The `gsc-admin` tool modifies your `chat.json` configuration file, which defines your LLM setup.

---

### Accessing `gsc-admin`

*   **NPM Installation:** Navigate to the root directory of your cloned `chat` repository and run `bin/gsc-admin` followed by the command (e.g., `bin/gsc-admin llm list models`).
*   **Docker Installation:** Use the `gsc-docker` helper script to proxy commands into the running container (e.g., `gsc-docker admin llm list models`).

Throughout this document, we'll use the generic `gsc-admin` prefix, but remember to use the appropriate method for your installation.

---

### 1. Listing Models and Providers

Before making changes, it's often useful to see your current configuration.

#### List All Registered LLM Providers

This command shows you the names of your configured providers and the environment variables they expect for API keys.

```bash
gsc-admin llm list providers
```

**Example Output:**

```
Registered LLM Providers:
- Name: OpenAI
  API Key Env: OPENAI_API_KEY

- Name: Anthropic
  API Key Env: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

- Name: My Custom AI
  API Key Env: MY_CUSTOM_AI_API_KEY
  Base URL: https://api.mycustomai.com/v1
```

#### List All Registered LLM Models

This command displays all your configured LLM models and any dividers, in their current order.

```bash
gsc-admin llm list models
```

**Example Output:**

```
Models and Dividers (Current Order):
0: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic) [default]
1: ---------
2: GPT-4o (OpenAI)
3: GPT-3.5 Turbo (OpenAI)
4: My Custom GPT-4 (My Custom AI)
```

---

### 2. Adding Models and Providers

You can add new LLM providers and models to your GitSense Chat configuration.

#### Add a New LLM Provider

This command guides you through adding a new LLM provider, prompting for its display name, API key environment variable name, and an optional base URL.

> **Important Note on Provider Compatibility:**
> Currently, GitSense Chat primarily supports LLM providers that offer an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint, as well as Anthropic. Ensure your custom provider adheres to one of these API specifications for proper integration.

**Interactive Prompts:**

*   `? Enter the display name for the new provider (e.g., 'My Custom AI'):`
*   `? Enter the name of the environment variable for the API key (e.g., 'MY_CUSTOM_AI_API_KEY'):`
*   `? Enter the base URL for the API endpoint (optional, e.g., 'https://api.mycustomai.com/v1'):`
*   `? Confirm adding this provider to chat.json? (y/N)`

#### Add a New LLM Model

This command allows you to add a new LLM model and associate it with an existing provider. It also lets you set it as the default model and place it in the model list.

```bash
gsc-admin llm add model
```

**Interactive Prompts:**

*   `? Select the provider for this model:` (Lists existing providers, or an option to create a new one)
*   `? Enter the display name for the new model (e.g., 'My Custom GPT-4'):`
*   `? Enter the model ID: (e.g., 'gpt-4o', 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022')`
*   `? Enter the max allowable output tokens: (e.g., 8192, 20000)`
*   `? Should this be the default model? (y/N)`
*   `? Where would you like to place this item? (Optional)`
    *   `(Enter 0-based index, 'top', 'end', 'before <num>', 'after <num>')`
*   `? Would you like to add a divider near this new model? (y/N)`
    *   `(If yes) ? Add divider (before/after) the new model?`
*   `? Confirm adding this model (and optional divider) with the above order? (y/N)`

#### Add a Divider

Dividers (`---------`) can be added to visually separate models in the UI.

```bash
gsc-admin llm add divider
```

**Interactive Prompts:**

*   `? Where would you like to place this item? (Optional)`
    *   `(Enter 0-based index, 'top', 'end', 'before <num>', 'after <num>')`
*   `? Confirm adding this divider with the above order? (y/N)`

You can also add dividers non-interactively using options:
*   `gsc-admin llm add divider --index 2` (adds at index 2)
*   `gsc-admin llm add divider --before "GPT-4o"` (adds before GPT-4o)
*   `gsc-admin llm add divider --after 0` (adds after the item at index 0)

---

### 3. Removing Models and Providers

You can remove existing LLM models and providers.

#### Remove an LLM Provider

This command removes a provider. It will prevent removal if any models are still associated with it.

```bash
gsc-admin llm remove provider [name]
```

*   If `[name]` is provided, it attempts to remove that specific provider.
*   If `[name]` is omitted, it will prompt you to select from a list.

**Example:**

```bash
gsc-admin llm remove provider "My Custom AI"
```

#### Remove an LLM Model

This command removes a model from your configuration.

```bash
gsc-admin llm remove model [name_or_index]
```

*   If `[name_or_index]` is provided, it attempts to remove that specific model.
*   If `[name_or_index]` is omitted, it will prompt you to select from a list.

**Example:**

```bash
gsc-admin llm remove model "My Custom GPT-4"
```

#### Remove a Divider

This command removes a divider.

```bash
gsc-admin llm remove divider [index]
```

*   If `[index]` is provided, it attempts to remove the divider at that specific index.
*   If `[index]` is omitted, it will prompt you to select from a list.
*   Use `--all` to remove all dividers: `gsc-admin llm remove divider --all`

**Example:**

```bash
gsc-admin llm remove divider 1
```

---

### 4. Reordering Models and Dividers

You can change the display order of your LLM models and dividers.

#### Move a Model

This command moves an LLM model to a new position in the list.

```bash
gsc-admin llm move model [name_or_index]
```

*   If `[name_or_index]` is provided, it attempts to move that specific model.
*   If `[name_or_index]` is omitted, it will prompt you to select from a list.
*   You will then be prompted for the target position (e.g., `to 0`, `up`, `down`, `before "GPT-4o"`, `after 2`).

**Example:**

```bash
gsc-admin llm move model "GPT-3.5 Turbo" to 0
```

#### Move a Divider

This command moves a divider to a new position.

```bash
gsc-admin llm move divider [index]
```

*   If `[index]` is provided, it attempts to move the divider at that specific index.
*   If `[index]` is omitted, it will prompt you to select from a list.
*   You will then be prompted for the target position.

**Example:**

```bash
gsc-admin llm move divider 1 after "Claude 3.5 Sonnet"
```

#### Interactively Reorder Models

This command launches an interactive mode where you can continuously issue commands to reorder models and dividers with a live preview.

```bash
gsc-admin llm order models
```

**Interactive Commands (within this mode):**

*   `move model <name_or_index> to <target_index>`
*   `move divider <index> up`
*   `move divider <index> down`
*   `add divider after <name_or_index>`
*   `remove model <name_or_index>`
*   `remove divider <index>`
*   Type `done` to apply changes, or `cancel` to exit without saving.
