## The GitSense Chat Flow

This document outlines the unique, powerful workflow designed to help you master your interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs) within GitSense Chat. It's a "Conversation First" approach that ensures precision, traceability, and efficiency, especially for complex tasks like code generation, data analysis, and knowledge management.

### I. Core Principles of the GitSense Chat Flow

The GitSense Chat Flow is built upon several fundamental principles:

1.  **Conversation First:** The conversation itself is the primary artifact. It's not just a log of prompts and responses, but a rich, auditable record of the human-AI collaboration that leads to a solution.
2.  **LLMs are Probabilistic:** We acknowledge that LLMs are not mind-readers and their responses are probabilistic. The flow provides tools to steer, refine, and pivot conversations to achieve desired outcomes.
3.  **Context is King:** Precise and relevant context is paramount for high-quality LLM responses and cost-efficiency. The flow emphasizes intelligent context building and management.
4.  **Traceability & Auditability:** Every significant interaction, especially code generation, is tracked with unique identifiers, ensuring a clear lineage and understanding of contributions.
5.  **Extensibility:** The platform is designed to be extended, allowing for custom tools and actionable LLM output ("Decorators") to fit unique workflows.

### II. The GitSense Chat Flow: A Step-by-Step Journey

This section illustrates a typical, powerful workflow within GitSense Chat.

#### 2.1. Phase 1: Initial Context & Discovery

The journey begins by bringing your data into the chat and intelligently discovering relevant information.

1.  **Importing Your Knowledge Base (GitSense Chat Bridge):**
    *   **Action:** Use the `gscb` CLI tool (GitSense Chat Bridge) to import your Git repositories into the application's database. To learn more, please refer to the admininstration documents.
    *   **Benefit:** This populates the "Repositories" tree in your right sidebar, making your entire codebase "chatable" and available for context.
2.  **Starting Broad & AI-Guided Discovery:**
    *   **Action:** In the right sidebar, select a broad set of files (e.g., an entire repository branch or a large subdirectory) from the "Repositories" tree. Then, click the **"Review" button** above the tree to open the **Context Builder**.
    *   **Action:** Within the Context Builder, click the **"Ask AI" button**. This creates a new chat (or message) containing "Tiny Overviews" (concise summaries and keywords) of your selected files.
    *   **Action:** In this new chat, ask the LLM a high-level question (e.g., "Which files are related to user authentication?").
    *   **Benefit:** The LLM acts as an intelligent navigator, analyzing the "Tiny Overviews" to suggest a refined list of relevant files (identified by `(chat-id: N)` references). This is highly token-efficient, avoiding the need to load full content for initial discovery.
3.  **Loading Refined Context:**
    *   **Action:** The **Chat IDs Handler** automatically recognizes the `(chat-id: N)` references in the LLM's response and injects an interactive **"Context Loader Tool"**.
    *   **Action:** Click the **"Review, load and add"** link within the "Context Loader Tool" to bring *only these AI-suggested files* into your current chat.
    *   **Action:** (Optional, but recommended) Use the "Manage" feature within the "Context Loader" to delete any previous, broader context, ensuring a focused, lower-token conversation.
    *   **Benefit:** You now have a precise, manageable context for deeper analysis, significantly reducing token count and API costs for subsequent interactions.

#### 2.2. Phase 2: Iterative LLM Interaction & Steering

Once you have your refined context, the flow focuses on effectively guiding the LLM.

1.  **Crafting Precise Prompts (Resizable Input):**
    *   **Action:** Use the **resizable chat input box** (drag the grabber icon or click the up/down arrow) to comfortably type detailed, comprehensive prompts.
    *   **Benefit:** More detailed prompts lead to higher quality, more accurate, and often "one-shot" LLM responses, reducing the need for multiple clarifications.
2.  **Monitoring LLM Context (Token Tachometer):**
    *   **Action:** Keep an eye on the **"Tokens" count** in the "Overview" section of the right sidebar. This is your "LLM Tachometer."
    *   **Benefit:** Being aware of token usage helps you manage the LLM's context window, avoid diluted responses, and optimize API costs. If the count gets too high, it's a signal to refine your context or pivot.
3.  **Steering the LLM: Edit & Refresh:**
    *   **Action:** If an LLM response isn't quite right, hover over *your* previous message, click the **"Edit" icon** (pencil), refine your prompt, and click "Save." Then, click the **"Try Again" (refresh) icon** on the LLM's last response.
    *   **Action:** You can also edit the LLM's responses directly to remove inaccuracies, preventing the LLM from building on flawed information.
    *   **Benefit:** This is crucial for achieving precise, "one-shot" results. Every edit is tracked, providing valuable insights into your engagement and the iterative process that leads to successful outcomes.
4.  **Pivoting Conversations: Forking:**
    *   **Action:** If a conversation path isn't yielding desired results, hover over the message you wish to branch from, click the **"Fork" icon** and choose a relationship for the new chat (Child, Sibling, or **Swap**).
    *   **Benefit:** Forking allows non-destructive experimentation. The "Swap" option is particularly powerful, elevating a new, more fruitful conversational branch to the top of the relevant tree, making it the most accessible and "latest" conversation. This helps manage the probabilistic nature of LLMs.
5.  **Multi-Model Chatting:**
    *   **Action:** In the chat input bar, click **"Switch model"** to select a different LLM for your next message.
    *   **Benefit:** Get diverse perspectives, leverage specialized strengths, or simply get a "second opinion" from various LLMs, enhancing the quality and breadth of your AI-assisted work.
6.  **Managing Context After Code Modifications:**
    *   **Action:** After applying a code patch (or receiving a full code update) and saving it (even if not yet committed to Git), you can ensure subsequent LLM interactions reference the most up-to-date code. Use the **"Merge and Update (Working Directory)"** option (available on the latest 'Context' message) to reload the context based on your current local file state.
    *   **Benefit:** This ensures that the `Parent-UUID` and versioning for any new code generated or modified by the LLM accurately reflects the latest state of your code, maintaining a correct and unbroken lineage for traceability and future development.

#### 2.3. Phase 3: Code Generation & Review

For developers, this phase highlights how GitSense Chat supports the entire code generation lifecycle with unparalleled traceability.

1.  **Generating Code:**
    *   **Action:** Provide the LLM with precise instructions and context (from Phase 1 & 2) to generate code.
    *   **Benefit:** The refined context and iterative steering increase the likelihood of high-quality, "one-shot" code generation.
2.  **Handling Partial Code (Code Action / Show Full Code):**
    *   **Action:** If an LLM provides partial code (e.g., `// the rest the same`), use the **"Code Action" / "Show Full Code"** button (often next to code blocks). This launches a modal to get the full code, often in a new, clean forked chat.
    *   **Benefit:** Ensures you always get complete, usable code without cluttering your main conversation.
3.  **Reviewing Patches:**
    *   **Action:** If the LLM generates a code patch (diff), the **Patch Handler** automatically renders it with interactive UI controls to preview changes, apply them, or request a fix.
    *   **Benefit:** Streamlines the process of integrating LLM-generated code modifications.
4.  **Understanding Code Traceability (UUIDs & Versioning):**
    *   **Action:** Every LLM-generated code block is embedded with a unique **`Block-UUID`** and, if modified, a **`Parent-UUID`** and versioning.
    *   **Benefit:** This allows you to verify production code against its original AI-generated version, understand the full human-AI contribution, and simplify future code reviews by tracing the lineage of every code snippet back to its conversational origin.

#### 2.4. Phase 4: Leveraging & Organizing Output

The final phase focuses on extracting value from your conversations and maintaining an organized knowledge base.

1.  **Notes: Your Chatable Wiki:**
    *   **Action:** Use the **"Notes" button** on any message to create structured documentation, project overviews, or meeting summaries directly within your chat history. These notes are organized like a wiki.
    *   **Benefit:** You can "chat with" this content using an LLM (e.g., "Summarize this note," "Proofread this section") without incurring LLM API costs for creation, building a cost-effective, AI-queryable knowledge base.
2.  **Organizing Your Chat History (Tree Editor):**
    *   **Action:** Use the **"Edit" button** in the right sidebar (or the Options menu) to launch the **Tree Editor modal**. Here, you can rename chats and drag-and-drop them to reorganize your conversation hierarchy.
    *   **Benefit:** Keep your LLM interactions clear, focused, and easy to navigate, reflecting the actual progression of your projects and thoughts.
3.  **Extracting Value (Messages Tool):**
    *   **Action:** Open the **Messages Tool** from the Conversation Control Panel (top/left bar). Select specific messages, choose a format (e.g., "Tagged" for LLM input, "Simple" for notes), and copy them to your clipboard.
    *   **Benefit:** This is your export hub, allowing you to precisely extract and integrate valuable conversation content into other tools (like your IDE) or documentation.
4.  **Actionable LLM Output (Handlers & Decorators):**
    *   **Action:** Observe how LLM output is transformed into interactive elements (e.g., clickable `(chat-id: N)` references, interactive patches, expandable long messages via `---hidden-split---`).
    *   **Benefit:** GitSense Chat's extensible handler architecture allows for powerful integrations (e.g., clickable Jira links, in-chat data visualizations), making your AI interactions incredibly effective and useful.
5.  **Searching Your Knowledge Base:**
    *   **Action:** Use the `/search` command in the chat input to find anything across your imported Git repositories and chat history.
    *   **Benefit:** Quickly locate specific information, and leverage AI to intelligently guide you to the most relevant files in large datasets, optimizing token usage.
