## Organizing Your Conversations

GitSense Chat goes beyond a simple chat log, allowing you to structure your discussions, notes, and projects hierarchically. This guide will show you how to leverage these powerful organizational features to keep your LLM interactions clear, focused, and easy to navigate.

### 1. Navigating Your Chat History (The TreeTable)

Unlike traditional chat apps, GitSense Chat organizes your conversations like a project tree. This makes it incredibly easy to find related discussions, track progress on sub-tasks, and understand the lineage of your LLM interactions.

**How to use it:**
1.  On the **Home Page**, look for the **"History" section**. This is powered by our unique **TreeTable** component.
2.  In the **Chat Page**, the right sidebar also contains a **Navigation Tree** that shows your current chat's lineage and your imported repositories.
3.  **Expand/Collapse:** Click the **chevron icons** next to any chat or folder name to expand or collapse its sub-items. This helps you focus on relevant parts of your history.
4.  **"Latest" Column:** In the Home Page's History, click the zap icon in the **"Latest" column** to instantly jump to the most recent message in that specific branch of your chat tree, even if it's deeply nested. This is perfect for resuming work on active projects.
5.  **Breadcrumbs:** On the Chat Page, the breadcrumbs at the top show your current chat's position within its hierarchical family tree, providing a clear path back to parent conversations.

### 2. Notes: Your Chatable Wiki

GitSense Chat's 'Notes' feature is more than just a place for quick thoughts; it's a powerful, AI-integrated wiki. You can create structured documentation, project overviews, or meeting summaries directly within your chat history, and then 'chat with' that content using an LLM.

**How to Create a Note:**

1.  In any chat, hover over a message to reveal the **Message Actions**.
2.  Click the **"Notes" icon**.
3.  A **menu will appear**, allowing you to choose the **position** for your note:
    *   **Add Above:** Creates the note as a child of the message you hovered over.
    *   **Add Below:** Creates the note as a sibling to the message you hovered over.

OR

1.  Click the **"Notes" button** which will allow you to create a new "Notes Chat" (you can think of it as a new wiki page).
    *   **Rename the Note Chat:** Give your note a descriptive name.
    *   **Select an LLM Model:** By default, the 'GitSense Notes' model is used. This model is beneficial for creating initial wiki-like structures and documents because it prevents accidental LLM API costs, as no chat completion is performed. However, if you want to interact with your note using a real LLM (e.g., to ask questions or get summaries), you'll need to either:
        *   **Fork the Note Chat** and select a real LLM.
        *   Use the **'Switch model' option** in the chat input box (at the bottom of the chat app) to change the model for that chat.

Build an extensive, structured knowledge base that you can query with AI. The 'GitSense Notes' model ensures cost-free creation, while the flexibility to switch to a real LLM allows for interactive querying and summarization.

### 3. Renaming & Reorganizing Chats

**How to use it:**
1.  **Renaming Chats:**
    *   From the chat page, click the gear icon (top right corner) and select rename chat.
    *   Click the **"Edit" button** in the right sidebar. This will launch the **Tree Editor modal**. Double-click the chat's name in the editor to type a new title.
2.  **Reorganizing Chats (Tree Editor):**
    *   The **Tree Editor** (launched via the "Edit" button) provides a visual interface to manipulate your chat hierarchy.
    *   **Drag and Drop:** You can **drag and drop** chats to:
        *   Make them a child of another conversation (nesting them).
        *   Reorder them within their current level (changing their display order).
    *   This is perfect for grouping related discussions, tasks, or project phases.
3.  **Deleting Chats:**
    *   From the chat page, click the gear icon (top right cornder) and select "Delete chat" to remove the current conversation.
    *   Remember, these are 'soft deletes,' meaning they are hidden but not permanently removed, with future retrieval options planned.
