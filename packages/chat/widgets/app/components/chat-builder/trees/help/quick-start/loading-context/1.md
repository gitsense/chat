## Loading Context

Providing the AI with relevant context is **critical** for accurate, relevant, and cost-efficient responses. By curating the information your Large Language Model (LLM) sees, you ensure it understands your specific problem, reduces the chances of "hallucinations," and provides precise solutions.

**Why Context is King:**
*   **Precision & Accuracy:** Narrows the LLM's focus, leading to highly specific and correct answers.
*   **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces token consumption by sending only necessary information.
*   **Overcoming Limitations:** Helps the LLM manage its context window, ensuring it doesn't "forget" important details.

**Learn More:**

To master context management and learn how to effectively load, refine, and manage your LLM's knowledge base, we highly recommend going through our interactive tutorial:
