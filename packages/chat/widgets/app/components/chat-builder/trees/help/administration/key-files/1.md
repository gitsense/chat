## Key Files and Directories

Understanding the location and purpose of key files and directories is essential for managing, troubleshooting, and backing up your GitSense Chat installation. This guide outlines the most important components you should be aware of.

### 1. `data/chats.sqlite3` (Main Database)

*   **Purpose:** This is the core database file for GitSense Chat. It stores:
    *   All your chat conversations and messages.
    *   Metadata and content of imported Git repositories (via the GitSense Chat Bridge).
    *   Analyzer results (markdown and JSON)
*   **Location:**
    *   **NPM Installation:** Typically found at `./data/chats.sqlite3` relative to the root of your cloned `chat` repository.
    *   **Docker Installation:** Located inside the Docker volume at `/app/data/chats.sqlite3`. This volume is usually named `gitsense-chat-data` (as defined in `gsc-docker`).
*   **Importance:** This file contains all your valuable data. Regular backups of this file are highly recommended.

### 2. `chat.json` (Application Configuration)

*   **Purpose:** This JSON file stores the main configuration for your GitSense Chat application, including:
    *   Definitions of your LLM providers and models.
    *   Default settings for various features.
*   **Location:**
    *   **NPM Installation:** In the root directory of your cloned `chat` repository.
    *   **Docker Installation:** Located inside the Docker container at `/app/data/chat.json`. When using `gsc-docker`, changes made via `gsc-admin` are applied to this file within the container.
*   **Importance:** This file dictates which LLMs you can use and how the application behaves. It's automatically backed up by `gsc-admin` when changes are made.

### 3. `.env` (Environment Variables / API Keys)

*   **Purpose:** This file securely stores your sensitive API keys for LLM providers (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). It is *not* committed to version control.
*   **Location:**
    *   **NPM Installation:** In the root directory of your cloned `chat` repository.
    *   **Docker Installation:** In the dedicated directory where you downloaded `gsc-docker` and `.env.example` (e.g., `~/gitsense-chat-docker/`). This file is mounted into the Docker container as read-only.
*   **Importance:** Essential for connecting to LLM services. Always keep this file secure and out of version control.

### 4. `data/backups/chat_config/` (Configuration Backups)

*   **Purpose:** This directory stores automatic rolling backups of your `chat.json` file, created whenever you make changes using the `gsc-admin` tool.
*   **Location:**
    *   **NPM Installation:** `./data/backups/chat_config/` relative to the root of your cloned `chat` repository.
    *   **Docker Installation:** Inside the Docker volume at `/app/data/backups/chat_config/`.
*   **Importance:** Allows you to easily revert to previous `chat.json` configurations using `gsc-admin config restore`.

### 5. `bin/` (CLI Tools)

*   **Purpose:** This directory contains the executable command-line interface (CLI) tools for managing GitSense Chat.
*   **Key Tools:**
    *   `gscb`: The GitSense Chat Bridge wrapper, used for importing Git repositories.
    *   `gsc-admin`: The main administration tool for managing LLM models, providers, and configuration backups.
    *   `gsc-docker`: (For Docker installations) A helper script to manage the Docker container (start, stop, admin proxy).
*   **Location:**
    *   **NPM Installation:** `./bin/` relative to the root of your cloned `chat` repository.
    *   **Docker Installation:** Inside the Docker container at `/app/bin/`. The `gsc-docker` script is typically placed in a user-defined directory outside the container.
*   **Importance:** These tools are your primary interface for command-line administration of GitSense Chat.
