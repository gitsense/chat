## Mastering Context Management

For GitSense Chat, "Context Engineering" is not treated as a buzzword; it's a fundamental approach to enhancing the accuracy and relevance of Large Language Model (LLM) responses. For example, users can build their context simply by chatting with an LLM and leveraging our Analyzers to discover and precisely filter files based on any criteria they can imagine. In this document, we will guide you through the tools available for building, refining, and reusing context effectively.

For a comprehensive, hands-on learning experience, we recommend using the interactive tutorial on **[Mastering Context]({{chat-uuid-link}})**.

### Building Context Through Conversation

**Description:** In GitSense Chat, building and refining your LLM's context is a natural extension of your conversation. By simply interacting with the AI using natural language, you can intelligently discover and filter relevant files from your codebase based on complex criteria, leveraging the power of our custom Analyzers. These Analyzers, once created (simply by chatting), enable the AI to understand and act on your specific needs effortlessly.

**How to use it (example):** For instance, you can initiate context building by simply asking a question like "find all files with spelling mistakes in the hello world repo" in the chat input. This will bring a set of relevant files into your conversation. You can then further refine this context by instructing the AI, "trace the execution of this query and construct a context bundle with all affected files and include any reference files you may need to keep in context." The AI will then curate a precise context bundle for you.

**Learn More:** This seamless, conversational approach to context engineering allows for highly targeted and natural LLM interactions. To see this powerful capability in action and learn more about how to effectively use it, we recommend trying the interactive **[Mastering Context]({{chat-uuid-link}})** tutorial.

### Advanced Context Loading with the Context Builder

**Description:** The Context Builder is one of GitSense Chat's most powerful tools, allowing you to precisely curate the information you feed to your LLM. It's launched from the "Review" button in the Selection Component.

**Why it's useful:**
*   **Precision:** Select exactly the files the LLM needs.
*   **Efficiency:** Avoid overwhelming the LLM with irrelevant data, which can lead to better responses and lower token costs.
*   **Intelligent Discovery:** Use AI to help you find the most relevant context in large repositories.

**How to use it:**
1.  **Initial Selection:** Start by selecting files or chats from the "Repositories" tree in the right sidebar.
2.  **Launch Builder:** Click the **"Review" button** in the Selection Component (below the Quick Chat Buttons). This opens the Context Builder modal.
3.  **Refine with Filters:** Inside the Context Builder, use the filters:
    *   **Search Filter:** Find specific content within your selected items.
    *   **Metadata Filter:** Filter by Analyzer metadata (e.g. has_spelling_mistake is true).
    *   **Path Filter:** Filter by file paths (e.g., `src/utils/`).
    *   **Language Filter:** Focus on specific programming languages.
    *   **Keywords Filter:** Filter by keywords extracted from content. This is only available if the file has been analyzed with the provided GitSense Tiny Overview analyzer.
4.  **Leverage Metadata Insights/Filter:** This is a unique and powerful feature.
    *   **Purpose:** Filter content based on structured metadata extracted by LLM-powered Analyzers (e.g., `spelling_mistakes_in_comments`, `security_vulnerability_type`).
    *   **How to use:** Select an Analyzer, then create rules using fields, operators, and values. Click the **"Insights" button** to see a statistical breakdown of metadata values and generate filter rules automatically.
5.  **"Ask AI" for Intelligent Guidance:**
    *   **Purpose:** For very large datasets, the "Ask AI" button (in the Context Builder footer) allows an LLM to review "Tiny Overviews" (concise summaries) of your selected files.
    *   **Workflow:** You ask a high-level question (e.g., "Which files are related to user authentication?"). The LLM identifies relevant files based on their overviews and suggests a refined context bundle, which you can then load using the "Context Loader Tool." This saves tokens by avoiding full content analysis for initial discovery.
6.  **Load & Add:** After refining your selection, click **"Load"** to fetch the full content, then **"Add"** to insert it as a dedicated context message into your chat.

### Saving & Reusing Context Bundles

**Description:** The "Context Table" allows you to save frequently used sets of files or chats as reusable context bundles.

**Why it's useful:**
*   **Efficiency:** Avoid repetitive manual selection for common tasks (e.g., "all frontend files for Component X").
*   **Consistency:** Ensure the same context is used across different conversations or by different team members.

**How to use it:**
1.  **Save a Context:** After selecting items in the Context Builder and clicking "Load," click the **"Save" button** in the footer. Give your context bundle a descriptive name.
2.  **Load a Saved Context:** In the right sidebar, locate the **"Context Table"** (below the Selection Component). Click the checkmark in the saved context table. All the files/chats in that context bundle will be instantly selected in the Navigation Tree, ready for you to "Review" and "Add" to your current chat.

### GitSense Chat Bridge: Importing Repositories

**Description:** The GitSense Chat Bridge (`gscb` CLI tool) is the backend mechanism that imports your Git repository data into the application's database, making it available for context loading.

**Why it's useful:**
*   **Seamless Integration:** Treats your code base like chats.
*   **Foundation for Context:** Populates the "Repositories" tree in the Navigation Tree, which is the source for all your code-related context.

**How it works (high-level):**
*   The `gscb` CLI tool is run locally to ingest Git repository trees by ref (branch, tag, commit) which stores files and directories in a GitSense Chat SQLite database.
*   It processes file content, estimates tokens, and can perform incremental updates for efficiency.

### Working with Local Files (Working Directory Context)

**Description:** GitSense Chat allows you to load context not just from imported Git data, but also directly from your local "Working Directory."

**Why it's useful:**
*   **Real-time Context:** Always work with the absolute latest version of your files, even if they haven't been committed to Git yet.
*   **Local Development Integration:** Seamlessly integrate your local development environment with your LLM conversations.

**How to use it:**
1.  When selecting files in the Navigation Tree (or within the Context Builder), ensure you select the option to include files from your "Working Directory."
2.  The app will then grab the content directly from your local file system.
