## Managing Messages

Control and guide individual message content for clarity and efficiency, directly influencing LLM behavior.

**How to Do It:**

Hover over any message (from you or the assistant) to see action icons:
*   **Copy:** Copies the message content to your clipboard.
*   **Edit:** Allows you to modify message content.
    *   For **your messages**, editing and then clicking the **"Try Again" (refresh) icon** on the AI's last response is a powerful way to **steer the LLM's focus**, clarify prompts, or add more detail, leading to more precise and "one-shot" AI output.
    *   For **assistant messages**, you can edit to remove inaccuracies or irrelevant details. This is crucial for **preventing the LLM from "going astray"** in subsequent turns by building on flawed or misleading information.
    *   Every edit is tracked, providing valuable insights into the iterative process of human-AI collaboration and how you guide the AI.
*   **Trash:** Hides messages from view. These are 'soft deletes,' meaning they are hidden but not permanently removed, with future retrieval options planned.
    *   **Benefit for LLM Control:** Hiding irrelevant or redundant messages can help keep the conversation context cleaner, potentially reducing noise for the LLM in future interactions (though the LLM's context window is primarily managed by the Context Builder).
