## Starting and Stopping GitSense Chat

Understanding how to start, stop, and check the status of your GitSense Chat application is fundamental for daily operation and maintenance. This guide covers the commands for both NPM and Docker installations.

---

### 1. For NPM Installations

If you installed GitSense Chat using NPM, you'll use `npm` commands from your `chat` repository directory.

#### Start the Application

To start the application in the background:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be accessible on port `3357`.

#### Access the Application

Open your web browser and go to: [http://localhost:3357](http://localhost:3357)

#### Stop the Application

To stop the running application:

```bash
npm stop
```

#### Check Status

To check if the application is running:

```bash
npm run status
```

---

### 2. For Docker Installations

If you installed GitSense Chat using Docker, you'll use the `gsc-docker` helper script from the directory where you downloaded it (e.g., `~/gitsense-chat-docker/`).

#### Start the Application

To start the Docker container:

```bash
gsc-docker start
```

This command will:
*   Create a persistent Docker volume for your application data (if it doesn't exist).
*   Mount your `.env` file into the container.
*   Start the GitSense Chat application, accessible on port `3357`.

#### Access the Application

Open your web browser and go to: [http://localhost:3357](http://localhost:3357)

#### Stop the Application

To stop and remove the running container:

```bash
gsc-docker stop
```

#### Check Status

To check the status of the Docker container:

```bash
gsc-docker status
```

#### View Logs

To view the Docker container logs (press `Ctrl+C` to exit):

```bash
gsc-docker logs
```

### Important Note on Configuration Changes

After updating your `.env` file (for API keys) or `chat.json` (for LLM models/providers), you **must stop and then start** the application for the changes to take effect. A simple restart ensures the application reloads its configuration.
