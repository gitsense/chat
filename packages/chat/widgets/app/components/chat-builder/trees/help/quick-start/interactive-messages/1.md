## Interactive Messages: Your Chat Comes Alive

In GitSense Chat, messages from the AI are far more than just static text. They are dynamic, interactive elements designed to streamline your workflow and make your conversations incredibly powerful. Imagine your chat turning references into clickable links, or code into interactive tools!

**How Your Messages Become Actionable:**

Behind the scenes, the AI can embed special instructions within its responses. GitSense Chat recognizes these instructions and transforms parts of the message into useful, interactive features.

**Examples of What Your Messages Can Do:**

*   **Instant Context Loading:** When the AI suggests relevant files (e.g., `(chat-id: 123)`), those references become **clickable links** that let you instantly load those files into your conversation's context. No manual searching needed!
*   **Interactive Code Changes:** If the AI generates code modifications (patches), you won't just see raw text. You'll get an **interactive preview** that lets you easily review and apply the changes.
*   **Manage Long Responses:** For very long AI responses or documentation, the message can automatically **collapse** to keep your chat tidy, with a simple click to expand and view the full content.
*   **Smart Links & Data Retrieval:** Imagine the AI mentions a GitHub issue number (e.g., `GH-123`) or a Jira ticket. GitSense Chat can automatically turn that into a **clickable link** that opens the actual issue. We can even take it a step further by automatically retrieving and displaying details about that issue right within your chat!

**The Power to Customize: An Extensible Framework**

GitSense Chat is built on a highly flexible framework for creating message handlers. This means that developers and administrators can **easily create new types of interactive elements** to integrate with your specific tools and workflows. For instance, a new handler could be developed to turn a GitHub issue number into a clickable link, or to automatically retrieve and display details about a Jira ticket. This extensibility allows your chat experience to continuously evolve and become even more powerful.
