> GitSense Chat Help: Tutorials / Mastering Context / AI-Assisted Search

## Part 1 - Building a Quick List with AI-Assisted Search

One of the fastest ways to build a relevant context for your conversation is to use GitSense Chat's AI-assisted search. This allows you to ask natural language questions and have the LLM intelligently identify the most relevant files, especially when combined with your custom Analyzers.

---

### Step 0: Verify Analyzer Exists

Before we proceed, let's ensure the Analyzer you created in the "Creating Your First Analyzer" tutorial is available.

**Please copy the entire command below and paste it into your chat input, then press Enter:**

```
/ask is the analyzer tutorial-code-comment-analyzer-{{short-id-0}}::file-content::default available.  if not, can you list available analyzers.
```

If the Analyzer is not found, the LLM will list available Analyzers. You may need to recreate the Analyzer if it has expired (tutorial Analyzers expire after 60 minutes). Refer back to the "Creating Your First Analyzer" tutorial if needed.

**Quick Tip on Search Execution:**

When you use `/ask`, the search UI will load with your query pre-populated. You'll need to press **Enter again** to execute the search. If you prefer to execute the search immediately without seeing the UI first, you can use `!ask` instead (e.g., `!ask find all files...`).

---

### Step 1: Execute an AI-Assisted Search

We'll use the Analyzer you created in the "Creating Your First Analyzer" tutorial to find files with spelling mistakes across both the 'Hello World' and 'Hey World' repositories.

**Please copy the entire command below and paste it into your chat input, then press Enter:**

```
!ask find all files in the hello and hey world repos with spelling mistakes using the analyzer tutorial-code-comment-analyzer-{{short-id-0}}::file-content::default
```

> **Note on Analyzer Naming:**
> We are being explicit with the Analyzer's full ID (`tutorial-code-comment-analyzer-{{short-id-0}}::file-content::default`) to avoid confusion with other tutorial analyzers.
>
> In a real-world scenario, if you only have one Analyzer designed for spelling mistakes, you could simply describe its purpose (e.g., `/ask find all files with spelling mistakes in the hello world repo`) and the LLM would likely infer the correct Analyzer. However, for this tutorial, being explicit reduces any potential confusion.

### Step 2: Review and Load the Search Results

If your search was successful, you will find a list of matching files in the "Answer" section in the 'Search' message, and below it, you'll find a **'Review, load and add' link**. There might be a second or two delay before the link appears. Clicking the link will open the Context Builder tool, pre-populated with the files the LLM identified.

1.  Click the **'Review, load and add' link**.
2.  Click the checkbox in the table header to select all files.
3.  Immediately click the **'Load' button** in the modal's footer.
4.  Immediately click the **'Add' button** in the modal's footer.

> **Why click 'Load' then 'Add' right away?**
> For this initial step, we want to quickly get the files into your chat's context without diving into the Context Builder's advanced filtering features just yet. We'll explore those options later in this tutorial.

### Step 3: Verify Your New Context

If all went well, a new **'Context' message** should now appear in your chat. This message contains all the files with spelling mistakes that were identified by the LLM and loaded into your current conversation's context. You may also notice 'Merge' and 'Delete' links in the context message. These links will be covered in different parts of this tutorial.
