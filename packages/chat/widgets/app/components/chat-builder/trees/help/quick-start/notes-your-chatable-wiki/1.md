## Notes: Your Chatable Wiki

Create structured documentation, project overviews, or meeting summaries directly within your chat history. These notes are organized like a wiki and can be "chatted with" using an LLM. Best of all, creating notes doesn't incur LLM API costs!

**How to Do It:**
1.  In any chat, hover over a message (yours or the AI's) to reveal the **Message Actions**.
2.  Click the **"Notes" button**.
3.  You'll be prompted to create a new note, which becomes a new chat in your history, organized within the tree.

**Important Note on Costs:**

While creating and storing notes is free, any subsequent chat completion (i.e., asking an LLM to process or respond to the content of a note) will incur **input token costs**. The note's content will be sent to the LLM as part of the conversation's context.
