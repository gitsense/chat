## Forking Conversations

Take control of your conversations and navigate complex problem-solving with ease. Forking allows you to branch off discussions, explore new ideas, or correct course without ever losing your valuable chat history. It's your secret weapon for mastering the probabilistic nature of LLMs.

**How to Do It:**

1.  Hover over the message you wish to fork from.
2.  Click the **"Fork" icon**.
3.  Choose a relationship for the new chat:
    *   **Child:** The new chat becomes a direct sub-conversation of the message you forked from. Ideal for deep dives into a specific point.
    *   **Sibling:** The new chat is created at the same level as the original chat, sharing its parent. Useful for parallel explorations.
    *   **Swap:** This is a particularly powerful option! The *newly forked chat becomes the parent*, and the *original chat becomes its child*. This is perfect when a new conversational branch proves more fruitful and you want to elevate it to the top of the relevant tree, making it the most accessible and "latest" conversation.

**Key Benefit:**

Forking empowers you to experiment freely, pivot efficiently when an LLM conversation isn't going as planned, and maintain a perfectly organized, auditable record of every problem-solving attempt. It's essential for iterative development and getting the most out of your AI assistant.
