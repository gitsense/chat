## Part 2 - Using the LLM to Create a Context Bundle

You've successfully loaded a context using AI-assisted search. Now, let's explore how you can leverage the LLM itself to further refine your context and create specific "context bundles." This is incredibly useful when you want to focus on a subset of your current context, like files of a particular language or related to a specific feature.

---

### Step 1: Instruct the LLM to Create a Context Bundle

With the previous context (files with spelling mistakes) still in your chat, you can now ask the LLM to create a more focused bundle. For this example, we'll ask it to narrow down to JavaScript and Python files, which are present in both the 'Hello World' and 'Hey World' repositories.

**Please copy the entire message below and paste it into your chat input, then press Enter:**

```
Review the files in context and create a context bundle for JavaScript and Python files. Once I have the bundle, I will update the context.
```

> Note: Since LLM responses are probabilistic based on the most likely outcome, it is good practice to mention that you are going to update the context by removing files. If you don't do this, you may create a situation where things become confusing for it since a previous response may not make sense. However, if you mention that the context will be updated, it should be able to infer that the response was based on a previous existing context.

### Step 2: Load the LLM-Generated Context Bundle

If the LLM successfully interpreted your request, it will respond with a new message containing a list of files, and a **'Review, load and add' link** will appear at the bottom. This link represents the context bundle the LLM has prepared based on your instructions.

1.  Click the **'Review, load and add' link**.
2.  When the Context Builder appears, immediately select all items by clicking the checkbox in the table header.
3.  Immediately click the **'Load' button** in the modal's footer.
4.  Immediately click the **'Add' button** in the modal's footer.

If all went well, a **second 'Context' message** will now appear in your chat, containing only the JavaScript and Python files from the LLM-generated bundle.

> Note: By having the LLM reply with the file name and a chat identifier, GitSense Chat was able to verify that the file name and chat ID exist in one or more 'Context' messages and proceed to generate a context loader link. All of this was made possible by GitSense Chat handlers, and it highlights how you can enhance the chat experience with custom handlers, which you can learn more about in [Extending GitSense Chat: Custom Handlers & Decorators]({{Extending GitSense Chat: Custom Handlers & Decorators}}).

### Step 3: Clean Up Previous Contexts

At this point, your chat contains two 'Context' messages. Since the first 'Context' message contains files that are no longer relevant and duplicates (same JavaScript and Python versions), it is good practice to delete context that no longer serves a purpose to reduce token size and increase clarity. With GitSense Chat, this is quite simple since it provides a link to do just that.

In the **latest 'Context' message** you just added (the one with JavaScript and Python files), look for the **'Delete All Contexts Except Last' link**.

1.  Click the **'Delete All Contexts Except Last' link**.

This action will remove all previous 'Context' messages from your chat, leaving only the latest, most refined context bundle. Your chat now contains only the JavaScript and Python files that were part of the context bundle the LLM was instructed to make.

> Note: Nothing is lost. When you click the delete link, a copy is made, and only the copy will be edited. The original chat will become the child of the copy (which will become the new main version).

**Next Step:** Now that you know how to create and manage focused context bundles, let's learn how to add new context and consolidate multiple sources. Click the button below to start the next part.
