This area is designed for users who want to delve deeper into the architecture, advanced features, and extensibility options of the platform.

This section covers topics such as:

*   [**Context Builder: Advanced Reference**]({{Context Builder: Advanced Reference|chat-uuid-link}}): A comprehensive guide to the powerful Context Builder, including its interface, operational stages, and advanced filtering capabilities, especially with LLM-extracted metadata.
*   [**Extending GitSense Chat: Custom Handlers & Decorators**]({{Extending GitSense Chat: Custom Handlers & Decorators|chat-uuid-link}}): Learn about GitSense Chat's handler architecture, which allows you to create custom tools and interactive elements directly within chat messages, transforming static LLM output into dynamic UI components.
