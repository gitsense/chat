## Part 5 - Extracting Value: Using the Messages Tool

You've learned how to build and refine your LLM's context. Now, let's explore how to review and extract valuable information generated during your conversations using the **Messages Tool**. This tool makes it easy to manage, filter, and copy specific content from your chat history.

---

### Step 1: Access the Messages Tool

The Messages Tool is located in the **Conversation Control Panel**, a floating bar typically found on the left-hand side of your chat page (or at the top of the first message).

1.  Look for the **'MT' button** in the Conversation Control Panel.
2.  Click the **'MT' button**.

A modal window will appear, displaying the Messages Tool. This modal provides a centralized view of all messages in your current conversation.

### Step 2: Explore and Filter Messages

The Messages Tool modal is designed for easy navigation and filtering:

*   **Message Selection List (Left Panel):** On the left, you'll see a list of all messages in your current chat. Each message has a checkbox next to it, allowing you to select or deselect individual messages.
*   **Filter Options:** At the top of the modal, you can filter the messages displayed by:
    *   **Role:** Select 'User', 'Assistant', or 'System' to see messages from specific sources.

Feel free to experiment with these filters to see how they narrow down the message list. For instance, try selecting 'Assistant' and 'Context' to see only the context messages generated by the LLM.

> **Future Plans:** The ability to filter by message type (code, AI search result, context, etc.) is on the roadmap.

### Step 3: Select and Preview Content

Once you've filtered the messages, you can select the specific content you wish to review or extract.

1.  Click the **checkboxes** next to any individual messages you want to include.
2.  As you select messages, the **Message Preview (Right Panel)** will show a real-time preview of the combined content in a default format.

### Step 4: Choose Output Format and Copy (Optional)

While we won't copy anything in this tutorial, it's important to know that the Messages Tool allows you to format the copied content for different purposes:

*   **Simple:** Copies raw text.
*   **Tagged:** Adds special tags (e.g., `[USER]`, `[ASSISTANT]`) to help an LLM understand the context if you're feeding it back into another model or if you need an easy way to programmatically parse the messages.

When you're ready to extract, you would simply click the **'Copy' button** to copy the formatted content to your clipboard.

The Messages Tool is invaluable for preparing context for external tools, creating documentation, sharing insights, or simply auditing your conversation history.

> **Future Plans:** Copying is just the start. We aim to make it extremely easy to filter messages by keywords, types, and more. We want to make it easy for users to create decorators by simply chatting with an LLM to generate the rules/code. The message tool currently only supports copying, but much more is planned.
