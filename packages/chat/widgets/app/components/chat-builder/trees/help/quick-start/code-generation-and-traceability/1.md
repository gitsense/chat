## Code Generation & Traceability

In the era of AI-assisted development, understanding the origin and evolution of your code is paramount. GitSense Chat provides unparalleled traceability for LLM-generated code, enabling you to **track every change within a conversation** and **quantify the blend of AI vs. human contributions**. This is critical for future decision-making, auditing, and understanding the true efficiency of your development process.

**Key Features & Why They Matter:**

*   **Handling Partial Code:**
    *   If an LLM provides partial code (e.g., `// the rest the same`), use the **"Code Action" / "Show Full Code"** button (often next to code blocks). This launches a modal to get the full code, often in a new, clean forked chat.
    *   **Benefit:** Ensures you always get complete, usable code without cluttering your main conversation, while maintaining its traceable lineage.

*   **UUID-Based Traceability (The Core of Auditability):**
    *   Every LLM-generated code block receives a unique **`Block-UUID`**. Think of this as a permanent fingerprint for that specific piece of code.
    *   If an LLM modifies an *existing* code block (e.g., applying a patch or refining a previous generation), the new code block will include a **`Parent-UUID`** that points back to the `Block-UUID` of the original code it was derived from.
    *   **Versioning & Authorship:** Each modification also increments its version number (e.g., `v1.0.0` to `v1.1.0`), and the metadata includes a complete author history (listing both human and LLM contributions).
    *   **Why it's Critical for Decision Making:**
        *   **Quantify AI vs. Human Contribution:** By analyzing the `Parent-UUID` chain, versions, and authors, you can precisely see how much of a final code solution was initially generated by the AI, and how much was refined, corrected, or expanded upon by human input. This data is invaluable for assessing LLM effectiveness.
        *   **Auditability & Compliance:** Easily trace any line of code in production back to its exact conversational origin, understanding its full history and the human-AI collaboration involved.
        *   **Performance & Efficiency Insights:** Understand which types of prompts or LLM interactions lead to more "one-shot" code generation versus those requiring extensive human iteration, informing future prompt engineering and training strategies.

GitSense Chat ensures full traceability of LLM-generated code, making it the ideal place to **start and end** your coding conversations, providing the data needed for informed decisions about your AI-assisted development.
