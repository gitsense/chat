## Creating Your First Analyzer

In this interactive guide, you'll learn how to create your own custom AI tool, called an **Analyzer**, without writing any code! This Analyzer will help you identify common quality issues in your code comments.

### Why Create an Analyzer?

Analyzers are the key to transforming your unstructured code and documentation into a powerful, searchable knowledge base. Here's why they're invaluable:

*   **Unlock Intelligent Search:** By defining what an Analyzer looks for (e.g., spelling mistakes, security vulnerabilities), you teach the AI how to understand and query your data effectively. This enables natural language searches, such as:
    `/ask find all files in the hello world repo with spelling mistakes`
    The LLM, understanding your Analyzer's capabilities, can then intelligently use it to find exactly what you need.
*   **Automate Data Extraction:** Turn free-form text (like code comments or meeting notes) into structured, filterable metadata.
*   **Streamline Code Reviews:** Quickly identify specific issues across your codebase (e.g., all files with outdated comments).
*   **Enhance Context Building:** Use extracted metadata to precisely filter and select relevant files for LLM context, saving tokens and improving response accuracy.

In short, Analyzers make your data smarter and your AI interactions far more powerful.

### Step 1: Launch the "New Analyzer" Chat

1.  Look for the **"Analyzers" button** in the **right sidebar** (located below the large token estimator/tachometer).

    *Figure 1: Where to find the Analyzers button in the right sidebar.*

    Click the button to load the **Analyzers** modal.

    *Figure 2: The Analyzers modal showing available options.*

    Click the **New Analyzers** button to load the settings modal.

    *Figure 3: The New Analyzer settings modal.*

    You can **optionally** give the chat session a custom name, but you must select an LLM to guide you through the creation process. The more capable the LLM, the better the instructions will be.

    Click the **"Go"** button to open the "New Analyzer" chat.

**Important** After clicking "Go", this tutorial page will change to the "New Analyzer" chat. To come back, just click the "Back" button in your browser.

### Step 2: Tell the Analyzer LLM What You Want

Once the "New Analyzer" chat is open, you'll see a prompt asking for Analyzer requirements. We have prepared a clear request for you.

**Please copy the entire text below and paste it as your first message into the "New Analyzer" chat:**

```
I want to create an analyzer with the id 'tutorial-code-comment-analyzer-mw61m3::file-content::default'. Its main purpose is to help me find issues in my code comments. Specifically, I want it to catch any spelling mistakes, identify comments that are no longer accurate (especially if a function's comment describes parameters that don't match the actual code), and detect references to function names that don't exist or are incorrect in the code. For the description, use "Identifies and reports issues in code comments, including spelling errors, outdated parameter descriptions, and incorrect function references."

For the human-readable report (Markdown output), please provide a clear summary of the findings for each file. If there are issues, I need specific details, like the exact spelling mistake, which function has an outdated parameter comment, or which function name in a comment is incorrect, so I can quickly locate and fix it in the code.

For the structured data (metadata), I need to know:
*   If there are any spelling mistakes (`has_spelling_mistakes`).
*   The count of unique spelling mistakes (`spelling_mistakes_count`).
*   If any comments are outdated (`outdated_comment_detected`).
*   The type of outdated comment, specifically if it's a parameter mismatch (`outdated_comment_type`).
*   If any comments refer to incorrect or non-existent function names (`incorrect_function_reference_detected`).
*   A brief summary explaining why a comment was flagged as outdated or having an incorrect function reference (`relevance_summary`).

And for the metadata to show, please include the newly defined metadata `has_spelling_mistakes`, `outdated_comment_detected`, and `relevance_summary`. There is no need to include the file_path metadata as it will be obvious during the analyzing stage.
```

> Note: The instructions may appear overly formal and complex, but this ensures most LLMs can easily process the request for this tutorial without needing clarification.

### Step 3: Confirm to Start

After sending your message, the LLM will summarize the requirements you provided and ask for your confirmation.

Please type `yes` and press Enter to confirm and proceed with the Analyzer creation.

*Figure 4: The LLM's confirmation message after receiving the Analyzer requirements.*

### Step 4: Save Analyzer Configuration

If everything goes smoothly, a green button labeled "Save Analyzer Configuration" will appear. Click it to finalize and create your analyzer.

![Save Analyzer Configuration Button](/api/v0/widgets/chat/app/static/creating-your-first-analyzer-save-button-bordered.png)
*Figure 5: The "Save Analyzer Configuration" button.*

To double-check that the analyzer was saved correctly, click the "Analyzers" button and you should find the newly created analyzer **tutorial-code-comment-analyzer-{{short-id-0}}**.

### Important: Tutorial Analyzers are Temporary

Tutorial analyzers will automatically expire 60 minutes after creation. To refresh, repeat the steps in this tutorial.
