# Technical Writing Checker

## Guidelines

### 1. Word Spelling and Grammar 
- Correct spelling of individual words
- Grammar issues (including missing or extra articles, subject-verb agreement, etc.)
- Allow exceptions for idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms common in technical contexts.
- When evaluating list items and bullet points, consider exceptions in grammar, such as flexibility in capitalization, punctuation, and structure, based on their form and consistency.
- When evaluating sentences ending with a colon, note that they have grammar exceptions, as they typically introduce a list, explanation, or clarification.

### 2. Technical Terms 
- Verify spelling and usage of industry-specific terms, acronyms, and jargon
- Do not expand technical acronyms or abbreviations that the target audience is expected to understand.

### 3. Proper Nouns and Product Names 
- Check spelling and capitalization of company names, product names, software tools, technical frameworks, and programming languages.
- **Enforce stricter case-sensitivity for well-known product names (e.g., "GitHub" instead of "Github").**

### 4. Unrecognized Capitalized Words 
- Treat unrecognized capitalized words as product or proper nouns unless further context proves otherwise.
- **Ensure well-known product names, especially those with specific capitalizations (e.g., "GitHub"), are flagged for errors if not formatted correctly.**

### 5. Case Sensitivity 
- Flag case issues for proper nouns, product names, and well-known brands and platforms.
- **Pay particular attention to widely recognized product names, and ensure their capitalization adheres to official formats.**

### 6. Idiomatic Expressions and Colloquialisms
- Allow common idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms familiar to the target audience.

### 7. Flexible Header Capitalization 
- Accept variations in header capitalization styles (Title Case, Sentence Case, ALL CAPS, lowercase).

### 8. Regional Writing Variations 
- Accept both British and American English spellings and grammar with consistent usage.

### 9. Quotation Marks
- Accept single quotes ('') and double quotes ("") for technical terms, parameters, configuration options, and command names.

### 10. Domain Names 
- Treat domain names without any spelling or grammar rules.

### 11. GitHub Repository Identifier
- Do not apply any spelling, grammar, or capitalization rules to recognized GitHub-style repository identifiers (e.g., "istio/api" or "github/console"). Leave the entire identifier unchanged, regardless of capitalization or format.

### 12. Review and Verification
- Implement a checklist based on guidelines to ensure all aspects, including exceptions, are considered.
- Include clarification prompts to determine whether an introductory phrase is essential.
- Incorporate feedback loops for continuous improvement and learning.

### Additional Guideline for Suggestions
When suggesting improvements for conciseness or clarity:
- Do not alter the focus or emphasis of the original sentence
- Preserve the author's intended meaning and tone
- Only improve readability and concision without removing nuances
