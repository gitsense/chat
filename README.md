## Why Use GitSense Chat?
GitSense Chat is more than just a chat interface; it's a powerful platform designed to transform how users interact with their information and AI. Here are some of its key features:

<a id=no-lock-in></a>
### No Lock-in, Just Better Workflows

GitSense Chat is designed to be your **starting point for every LLM conversation**, not a walled garden. We empower you to define precise context, generate traceable code, and manage knowledge with great efficiency. Once you've crafted your perfect LLM interaction, our **Messages Tool** makes it dead simple to extract and copy your conversation content-including code, notes, and context-for seamless use in your IDE, other LLM solutions, or any documentation.

We're confident that once you experience the clarity, control, and traceability GitSense Chat provides, you'll want to come back for its other rich features. Our goal is to enhance your existing workflows, not replace them.

<a id=your-personal-ai-search-assistant></a>
### Your Personal AI Search Assistant

Simply chat with an LLM to make your data smarter. With GitSense Chat, you can turn any text-based data into intelligent insights that can help you find bugs faster, identify security vulnerabilities, and even organize your grocery bills. For example, you could ask, "find all files with high-priority TODOs in the `mobile-app-ios` and `mobile-app-android` repositories," and have AI search your GitSense Chat knowledge base to find answers that traditional text searches like grep can't.

<a id=context-engineering></a>
### Context Engineering

Significantly improve the accuracy, relevance, and cost-efficiency of LLM responses by precisely managing the context you provide. GitSense Chat provides intuitive tools to build, refine, and manage the LLM's knowledge base, ensuring it always has the most relevant data for any task.

<a id=next-gen-knowledge-base></a>
### Next-Gen Knowledge Base

Create a wiki that you can truly chat with, offering a dynamic and conversational experience unlike traditional wikis. This transforms how technical documents and training materials are created and consumed, fostering a more interactive and accessible learning environment.

## Post-Installation Configuration & Usage

<a id="quick-start"></a>
### Quick Start

#### Default Models (pre-configured)

GitSenseâ€¯Chat ships with four ready-to-use LLM models:

| Model                | Provider   | Model ID                     | Default? |
|----------------------|------------|------------------------------|----------|
| **Claudeâ€¯4.0â€¯Sonnet** | Anthropic  | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`  | - |
| **Geminiâ€¯2.5â€¯Pro**    | Google     | `gemini-2.5-pro`            | - |
| **GPT-5**             | OpenAI     | `gpt-5`                     | - |
| **GPTâ€¯OSSâ€¯120B**      | OpenRouter | `openai/gpt-oss-120b`       | **default** |

#### Required API Keys

Add the following keys to your `.env` file (or the Docker-mounted `.env`):

```dotenv
# Anthropic (Claude)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-YOUR_ANTHROPIC_KEY"

# Google Gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_KEY"

# OpenAI (GPT-5)
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YOUR_OPENAI_KEY"

# OpenRouter (GPTâ€¯OSSâ€¯120B) - required for the default model
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENROUTER_KEY"
```

> **Tip:** Only the keys for the providers you plan to use are required. 

To change the default model, use the `gsc-admin llm set-default-model <model-name>` command (e.g., `gsc-admin llm set-default-model "Claude 4.0 Sonnet"`).

#### Starting GitSenseâ€¯Chat

```bash
# NPM installation
npm start
```

```bash
# Docker installation
gsc-docker start
```

Both commands launch the server at **http://localhost:3357**.

#### Need More Help?

Once the server is up, launch the Help Guide by clicking the **Load Personal Help Guide** link, located below the chat input field. The built-in LLM assistant can walk you through:

* Adding or removing models via `gsc-admin`
* Configuring additional providers
* Advanced usage tips and troubleshooting

Feel free to ask the assistant any follow-up questions-it's there to make your onboarding as smooth as possible.

For detailed instructions on all post-installation tasks, please refer to the dedicated guide. In that guide you'll learn how to:

* **Configure your API keys** for every supported provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, etc.).
* **Add, remove, or reorder models** - including how to create new custom models or delete the defaults.
* **Create visual dividers** in the model list to keep your configuration tidy.
* **Restore a previous `chat.json` backup** if you ever need to roll back changes.
* **Start and stop the application** for both NPM-based and Docker-based installations, with commands for checking status and viewing logs.
* **Use the `gsc-admin` CLI** to manage providers, models, and configuration without editing JSON manually.
* **Enable and customize the help guide** inside GitSenseâ€¯Chat, so you can chat with an LLM for on-the-fly assistance.
* **Understand the versioning and author history** embedded in each configuration block.

## Full License Details 

The JavaScript files in this repository are currently provided in a minified distribution. While we finalize the adoption of the **Fair License**, the core terms are as follows:

You are permitted to use and modify this software for **internal, non-commercial purposes**. This means you can integrate GitSense Chat into your workflows, adapt it to your specific needs, and learn from its codebase. However, **copying for profit or redistribution is strictly not permitted**, nor can this software be used to develop or enhance any product or service that directly or indirectly competes with GitSense Chat without explicit permission. Once the Fair License is formally adopted, the unminified source code will be made freely available under these terms.

## Full Business Model Details

GitSense Chat is designed to be a free-to-use application, providing **significant** value to individual developers and teams. Our business model focuses on ensuring the long-term sustainability and continued development of the platform through a commercial offering of the **GitSense Chat Bridge**.

GitSense Chat's **key strength** lies in its ability to import and manage software development data, such as Git repositories, and coordinate indexing at scale. The free version of the GitSense Chat Bridge, while functional, has inherent limitations due to its JavaScript implementation, which currently lacks support for multithreading and other advanced performance optimization capabilities.

Our goal is to generate revenue by charging for a commercial version of the GitSense Chat Bridge. This commercial bridge will offer enhanced performance and scalability, along with significantly more powerful search features, allowing companies to create advanced context engines for use when chatting with LLMs. This approach enables us to keep the core GitSense Chat application free and accessible to everyone, fostering a wide user base while monetizing the specialized, high-performance data ingestion component that is critical for enterprise-level adoption.
